#### Installation via LipUI

LipUI brings an unprecedented, elegant and clean installation experience to LiteLoaderBDS users. We recommend all users who lack command line knowledge to use LipUI to install LiteLoaderBDS.

First you need to install Lip, please refer to the [Lip documentation](https://docs.lippkg.com). Then, download [LipUI](https://github.com/LiteLDev/LipUI/releases/latest) and run it.

First, you need to specify the working path, which is the directory where the BDS and LiteLoaderBDS need to be placed. If you don't know what to choose, feel free to create a new folder and select it.

![LipUI Main Window](../assets/img/lipui_main_window.png)

Then, go to the package marketplace and select the package you need to install. In order to run LiteLoaderBDS, you need to install BDS and LiteLoaderBDS. If you would like to experience the convenience of one-click installation, you can install **Starter Pack**, which contains the most commonly used plugins as well as LiteLoaderBDS and BDS.

![LipUI Registry](../assets/img/lipui_registry.png)

There are also various plugins in the package marketplace that you can install according to your needs. For example, you can install AntiToolbox to prevent players from using Toolbox, LLAntiCheat to prevent players from using plugins, and LLEssentials to add online basics to the server.

#### Installation via Lip

We recommend using [Lip](https://docs.lippkg.com) to install LiteLoaderBDS. You need to install Lip first, please refer to the [Lip documentation](https://docs.lippkg.com). If Lip is already installed, please follow the steps below to install LiteLoaderBDS:

For LiteLoaderBDS 2.10.0-beta.1 and earlier, there is no BDS automatic installation mechanism, you can run the following command to install BDS. Please note the version correspondence.

```shell
lip install github.com/tooth-hub/bds@1.19.61
```

1. Run the following command in the BDS directory.

    ```shell
    lip install github.com/tooth-hub/liteloaderbds
    ```

2. For LiteLoaderBDS 2.9.3 and earlier, there is no post-installation script provided, so you need to run `LLPeEditor.exe` in the BDS directory and wait for the program to prompt to close to complete the post-installation task.

3. Run `bedrock_server_mod.exe` in the BDS directory to start the server. Please note that you should always run `bedrock_server_mod.exe` to start the server.

If you wish to install another version of LiteLoaderBDS, you can run a command similar to the following.

```shell
lip install github.com/tooth-hub/liteloaderbds@2.9.2
```

#### Manual installation

If you do not want to use Lip, or if you want to do some advanced operations, you can install LiteLoaderBDS manually. follow these steps to install it:

1. Download the corresponding version of `LiteLoaderBDS.zip` from <https://github.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDSv2/releases>.
2. Unzip the downloaded file into the BDS directory.
3. Run `PeEditor.exe` in the BDS directory.
4. Run `bedrock_server_mod.exe` in the BDS directory to start the server.

### Installing on a Linux distribution

You can run the latest BDS + LiteLoaderBDS on a Linux server with **Wine 8.0 or higher**. You can install plugins and access the game normally. So if you are using a Linux server, you can install Wine to run BDS and get almost the same experience and performance as Windows platform.

#### Via Docker/Podman

Please install **Docker** or **Podman** first, then modify the following command

```shell
docker run --name liteloader -v /path/to/store:/server -p 19132:19132/udp -it -d docker.io/shrbox/liteloader:main
```

If you are using **podman**, please replace `docker` with `podman`  
`--name liteloader` **liteloader** is container's name, you can change it freely  
Please replace `/path/to/store` with the directory which will be used for storaging BDS, for example: **/home/ubuntu/server**(specified directory must exist)  
`-p 19132:19132` The first port is host port, the second port is port in the container, you'd better to keep these two ports same

Managing servers by these commands

| Command                  | Operation            | Comment                                        |

#### Via script

You should install Wine before execute this script, we recommend Wine 8.0+  
In the directory where you want to install the server, run:

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiteLDev/LiteLoaderBDSv2/develop/scripts/install.sh && sh install.sh
```

## üöÖ Update LiteLoaderBDS

When a new Minecraft bedrock version is released, you need to update to make the server side adapt to the latest client.

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that some plugins, maps, etc. have additional requirements for the update operation, which may result in data corruption if you follow the steps below. Please do your data backup work.

### Updating BDS on Windows

When updating, please follow the following steps.

1. Delete all files except `allowlist.json`, `permissions.json`, `server.properties`, `plugins` and `worlds` from the directory where the server is located.
2. Extract all the contents of the Bedrock version of the new LiteLoaderBDS (BDS) package for Minecraft, except `allowlist.json`, `permissions.json` and `server.properties`, to the server directory. . This step should not result in an overwrite prompt.
3. Install the new LiteLoaderBDS.
4. Put the backup files back to the server directory and overwrite the files with the same name.

### Update LiteLoaderBDS on Windows

If BDS is not updated, but LiteLoaderBDS is, you can use Lip to do the update.

In the BDS directory run.

```shell
lip install --upgrade github.com/tooth-hub/liteloaderbds
```

If you wish to update to a specific version, you can use the following command.

```shell
lip install --upgrade github.com/tooth-hub/liteloaderbds@2.9.2
```

If you wish to roll back to a specific version, you can use the following command.

```shell
lip install --force-reinstall github.com/tooth-hub/liteloaderbds@2.9.2
```

If you do not wish to use Lip, you can update LiteLoaderBDS manually by following the steps in [Updating BDS on Windows](#Update BDS on Windows).

### Updating BDS on Linux

To update, please follow these steps.

1. Back up `allowlist.json`, `permissions.json`, `server.properties`, `plugins`, `worlds` in the directory where the server is located.
2. Delete the server.
3. Install the new version of LiteLoaderBDS.
4. Put the backup file back to the server directory and overwrite the file with the same name.

If BDS is not updated, but LiteLoaderBDS is updated, you must also follow the above steps.

## üéØ Installing plugins

There are two types of plugins: native plugins and scripted plugins. Native plugins are compiled native plugins with better performance, but they cannot be re-enabled or disabled after the server is started. Scripted plugins are written in JavaScript or Lua and can be managed flexibly with better security, but have poorer performance.

> [!WARNING]
> To ensure that most plugins work properly, set `online-mode` to `true` in `server.properties` and `server-authoritative-movement` to `server-auth` or `server-auth-with- rewind`.

### Find your favorite plugins

You can look for plugins on these sites.

* [Official LipWebUI](https://www.lippkg.com/)(Recommended)
* [LiteLoaderBDS Forum](https://www.litebds.com/)
* [MineBBS (native plugin)](https://www.minebbs.net/resources/?prefix_id=59)
* [MineBBS (Scripting Plugin)](https://www.minebbs.net/resources/?prefix_id=67)

### Installation via Lip

If the plugin author provides a Lip compliant distribution repository or distributes the plugin as a Tooth package (with the suffix `.tth`), we recommend using [Lip](https://docs.lippkg.com) to install the plugin, because Lip can handle dependencies automatically, making it easier to install, upgrade and uninstall the plugin.

You need to install Lip first, please refer to the [Lip documentation](https://docs.lippkg.com).

If you need to add a plugin from a distribution repository, use a command similar to the following to install it.

```shell
lip install example.com/exampleuser/exampleplugin
```

If you have already obtained the Tooth package file, install it with a command similar to the following.

```shell
lip install myplugin.tth
```

Lip also provides support for installing Tooth package file URLs, such as

```shell
lip install https://example.com/myplugin.tth
```

You can run a command like the following to remove the plugin.

```shell
lip uninstall example.com/exampleuser/exampleplugin
```

If you need to remove the plugin but don't know the Tooth path of the plugin, you can run the following command to query all installed Tooth packages.

```shell
lip list
```

If you are not sure if a Tooth package is the plugin you need to remove, you can run a command like the following to see the plugin details.

```shell
lip show example.com/exampleuser/exampleplugin
```

### Manual installation

If you do not want to use Lip, or if the plugin does not provide Lip support for distribution, you can install the plugin manually. However, installing the plugin manually requires you to handle the dependencies yourself, which may cause the plugin to not work properly.

If the plug-in provides an installation guide, please follow it. If not, put all the contents of the plugin into the `plugins` folder.

If you need to remove the plugin, simply remove the file you put in when you added the plugin.

## üîå Managing plugins

You can manage these plugins with the following listed commands.

* `ll list`: list plugins
* `ll load plugins/xxx.js`: load a script plugin
* `ll unload plugin/xxx.js`: unload a script plugin
* `ll reload plugin/xxx.js`: reload a script plugin
* `ll reload`: reload all script plugins
* `ll version`: print LiteLoaderBDS version
* `ll upgrade`: check for updates to LiteLoaderBDS

### Cautions

* After uninstalling a plugin, the command it was registered with will not be completely removed, which may cause the player to be prompted that the command does not exist when trying to use it.
* If the interface exported by the uninstalled plugin is used by other plugins, the other plugins will not work.
* Do not uninstall or reload plugins when the server is not yet started or when there are players in the server, or the server will be at risk of crashing.
* When a plugin is loaded, the `onServerStarted` event and the `onPlayerJoin` event for all players will be fired in that plugin.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not load, unload, or reload any plugins in a production environment.

## üé® Installing add-on packages

Copy addon packages with filenames ending in `.mcpack`, `.mcaddon` or `.zip` to `plugins/AddonsHelper/` and restart the server. These addon packages will then be automatically added to the world.

You can manage them in the console with the `addons` command.
